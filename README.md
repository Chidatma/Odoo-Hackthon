# Project Overview

**FleetOps** is a comprehensive fleet management system built to eliminate inefficient, manual record-keeping and replace it with an intelligent, rule-driven digital command center.

This system enables:

- Real-time fleet visibility  
- Driver compliance enforcement  
- Automated dispatch validation  
- Preventative maintenance tracking  
- Fuel & expense analytics  
- Operational ROI reporting  

---

# Objective

To replace outdated manual logbooks with a centralized, rule-based digital hub that:

- Optimizes the entire delivery fleet lifecycle  
- Monitors driver compliance and safety  
- Tracks operational and financial performance  
- Improves decision-making through analytics  

---

# Target Users

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Fleet Managers** | Oversee vehicle lifecycle, maintenance, utilization |
| **Dispatchers** | Assign trips, validate loads, manage logistics |
| **Safety Officers** | Track license validity, compliance, safety scores |
| **Financial Analysts** | Monitor fuel spend, maintenance ROI, cost-per-km |

# Core System Pages

---

## Page 1: Login & Authentication

**Purpose:** Secure access based on user roles.

**Features:**

- Email / Password authentication  
- Forgot Password recovery  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Manager vs Dispatcher vs Analyst permissions  

---

## Page 2: Command Center (Main Dashboard)

**Purpose:** High-level fleet oversight.

### KPIs:

- **Active Fleet** – Vehicles currently “On Trip”  
- **Maintenance Alerts** – Vehicles marked “In Shop”  
- **Utilization Rate** – % Assigned vs Idle  
- **Pending Cargo** – Unassigned shipments  

### Filters:

- Vehicle Type (Truck / Van / Bike)  
- Status  
- Region  

---

## Page 3: Vehicle Registry (Asset Management)

**Purpose:** CRUD management of fleet assets.

### Data Points:

- Name / Model  
- License Plate (Unique ID)  
- Max Load Capacity (kg / tons)  
- Odometer Reading  
- Status Toggle: Available / On Trip / In Shop / Retired  

### System Logic:

- Manual toggle for “Out of Service”  
- Vehicles in "In Shop" state automatically removed from dispatch selection  

---

## Page 4: Trip Dispatcher & Management

**Purpose:** Manage delivery workflow from origin to destination.

### Features:

- Trip Creation Form  
- Assign Available Vehicle + Available Driver  
- Cargo Weight Validation  

### Validation Rule:

```
IF CargoWeight > MaxCapacity
THEN Trip Creation = Blocked
```

### Lifecycle:

Draft → Dispatched → Completed → Cancelled  

---

## Page 5: Maintenance & Service Logs

**Purpose:** Preventative and reactive maintenance tracking.

### Automation Logic:

- Adding vehicle to Service Log → Status automatically switches to **In Shop**
- Vehicle hidden from Dispatcher pool  
- On completion → Status reverts to Available  

---

## Page 6: Completed Trip, Expense & Fuel Logging

**Purpose:** Financial visibility per asset.

### Features:

- Log Fuel (Liters, Cost, Date)  
- Log Maintenance Expenses  
- Odometer Tracking  

### Automated Calculation:

**Total Operational Cost per Vehicle = Fuel + Maintenance**

---

## Page 7: Driver Performance & Safety Profiles

**Purpose:** Compliance and HR management.

### Compliance Rules:

- License expiry tracking  
- Assignment blocked if license expired  
- Vehicle category validation (e.g., Van license required for Van)  

### Performance Metrics:

- Trip Completion Rate  
- Safety Score  
- On-Time Delivery Rate  

### Driver Status:

On Duty / Off Duty / Suspended  

---

## Page 8: Operational Analytics & Financial Reports

**Purpose:** Data-driven decision making.

### Key Metrics:

**Fuel Efficiency:**

```
km per Liter (km/L)
```

**Vehicle ROI:**

```
(Revenue - (Maintenance + Fuel)) / Acquisition Cost
```

### Reporting:

- Monthly Payroll Reports  
- Fleet Health Audit Reports  
- One-click CSV Export  
- One-click PDF Export

# Logic & Workflow Summary

### Vehicle Intake

Add **Van-05**  
Capacity: 500kg  
Status: Available  

---

### Driver Compliance

Add Driver "Alex"  
System verifies license validity for Van category  

---

### Dispatching

Assign Alex → Van-05 → 450kg cargo  

Validation Check:

```
450 < 500 → PASS
```

Status Update:
- Vehicle → On Trip  
- Driver → On Trip  

---

### Trip Completion

Driver marks trip "Completed"  
Final Odometer entered  

Status Update:
- Vehicle → Available  
- Driver → Available  

---

### Maintenance Logging

Manager logs “Oil Change”  

Auto Logic:
- Status → In Shop  
- Hidden from Dispatcher  

---

### Analytics Update

System recalculates:

- Cost per km  
- Total operational cost  
- ROI metrics
